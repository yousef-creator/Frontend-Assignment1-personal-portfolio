🚀 Personal Portfolio
Full-Stack Web Development Portfolio and Experience Timeline
This repository contains the source code for the professional personal portfolio. It's a single-page HTML document designed to provide a comprehensive overview of my skills, 5+ years of experience, and contact information.

✨ Project Highlights
This portfolio is structured for clarity and efficiency, organized into three primary sections:

👤 About Me: A professional introduction, including my profile picture, social links, and a clear list of my key technical skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Angular).

⏰ Experience Timeline: A detailed, chronological table showcasing my professional history, roles, key achievements, and duration at companies like TeckCorp Solutions and Digital Agency Pro.

📧 Contact Me: A complete, interactive HTML form designed for potential clients or employers to submit detailed inquiries, project scope, budget range, and required services directly.

🛠️ Technology Stack
This project is built using foundational web technologies:

HTML5: Used exclusively for all structure, content organization, and layout (including the use of <table> elements for responsive design and layout).

CSS (Inline Styling): Basic visual presentation (color, alignment) is achieved using simple inline CSS.
